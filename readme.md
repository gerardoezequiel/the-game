# Tetris

The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.

## You knew that..?

Tetris was the first game to be played in outer space (by a human). 

We wanted to pay a little tribute to this addictive and very "spatial" game

In 1993, Russian Cosmonaut Aleksandr A. Serebrov blasted off aboard the Soyuz TM-17 rocket to the MIR Space Station. Stashed among his personal gear was a Nintendo Game Boy and a Tetris game cartridge. The game choice was particularly fitting because of the game’s origin in the Soviet Union in 1984.

By squeezing in a few rounds of Tetris (and then some, we’re sure) while aboard the space station, Serebrov helped Tetris become the first video game played in space. We imagine fellow Cosmonaut Vasily Tsibliev and French Spationaut Jean-Pierre Haigneré enjoyed more than a few turns with the device too, giving all three the distinction of being the first people to play a video game in space.

Serebrov’s Game Boy spent 196 days and 17 hours aboard MIR and, upon returning to Earth, eventually found its way to auction. In 1996, it was auctioned off as part of a Russian Space History auction hosted by Sotheby’s. Later, in 2011, it became available again and was auctioned off by Bonhams auction house for $1,220—the actual Game Boy unit and game unit are seen in the listing photo here.
